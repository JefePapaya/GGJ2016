Cats and their diabolic plans.

This is a typing game with 2d graphics developed using Unity3d
Made at the *Global Game Jam 2016*, Global BIND Jam, which had "Ritual" as the theme

## Story

It’s a hard life to be a cat.
You purrr, you be cutes, you pets humans… 
=^.^=
But humans no behave as they musts!
x_x
This obviously has a simple solution:
invoking a devil.
[One or two lives might be needed, but we has 9 to spare, right?]
Devils bring food, devils never yell
[“get off that table!”]
And…
Devils are warm.
Mmmm
Prrrr… rrr… rrr…

Now, you want to complete the right invocation moves before your human sees you!
