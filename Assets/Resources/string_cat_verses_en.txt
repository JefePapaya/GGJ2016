Mice are lovely, devils are cool.
Cats are lovely, 
bring me food.

Eat, sleep, prrr
repeat
Eatl, sleep, prrr
repeat

I prrr
You prrr
We prrr
Heuman where’s the food?

Fish, milk, bird
Swim, drink, fly,
come to our mouths
here you can hide.

Sleep all afternoon,
wake up ever cute,
run over your human,
they must pet you.

I has milk,
you has food, 
we fight, 
me wins,
life’s so good.
