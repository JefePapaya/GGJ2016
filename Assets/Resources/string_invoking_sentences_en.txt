Give us food now Diabolicat!

Care, food, cozy, Diabolicat wuvs us.

The quick brown devil comes jumping to the lazy cat.

Diabolicat, diabolicat, diabolicat! Come quick to my mat!

Gimme milk, gimme mice, gimme whenever me desires.

Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cathulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.

By the fur, by the milk, by the food. Diabolicat I calls you.

Lord Diabolicat, by your grace, grant me, I pray thee the power to be always cutee.
